LaTeX Slides styles using tikz

	Why is it?
		Beamer is the most popular class
		Among LaTeX packages for making presentation
		However, Beamer is too straight
		Interested by the slide design in ConTeXt
		Let's design some new styles in LaTeX

	Packages used
		[geometry] set the screen size
		[fancyhdr] set header and footer
		[titling] set title format
		[tikz] design the background
		[eso-pic] display the background

	How to use the *.cls
		using \documentclass{} to declare the class
		using \myfrontcover to show the title page
		using \tableofcontents to show the outline
		using \section{} to start a topic
		using \newpage to begin a new slide
		using \mybackcover to show the end page
		no more difference with LaTeX
